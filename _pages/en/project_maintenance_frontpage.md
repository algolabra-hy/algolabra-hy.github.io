## **First Things First**  

- During the course, all projects must be created as **Git repositories** on **GitHub**. If you are unfamiliar with this, check out [these instructions]({% link _pages/en/git.md %}).  
  - **Note:** Peer reviews for the project will be conducted using GitHub issues. To enable this, make sure to **[allow issues]({% link _pages/en/git.md %}#allowing-issues)** in your repository.  

- **Peer reviews and weekly feedback** will be managed through [Labtool](https://study.cs.helsinki.fi/labtool/).  
  - After creating your project repository, **register on Labtool** for the correct course using your university AD credentials.

## **Overview**

- **[Pylint]({% link _pages/en/pylint.md %})** is a static analysis tool for Python that helps maintain high code quality.

### **Projects in Java**  

- **[Gradle]({% link _pages/en/gradle.md %})** is a build automation tool primarily for Java, streamlining compilation and testing tasks.
