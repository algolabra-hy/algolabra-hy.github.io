This page collects examples of previously completed (good) projects. You can review these before starting your project. However, note that presenting others' code or content as your own is **not allowed** and will be considered cheating. Even mechanical modification of someone else's code is considered plagiarism, just as in other written works at the university.
We ask for separate permission to present assignments on these pages.
