_Original instructions by Mika Huttunen and Silja Polvi. Jeremias Berg has updated the instructions._

# Getting Started
DO NOT use the Git plugin provided by NetBeans or any graphical programs. So far, all problems in this course where students have lost a day's coding work have been caused by these. Always use the terminal in Linux/OSX or Git Bash in Windows, and perform commits and pushes manually.

First, check if Git has been installed on your computer by running the command ```git -v``` in the terminal. The output should look something like this:
```  
jezberg@LM2-500-27156 ~ % git -v 
git version 2.39.3 (Apple Git-145)
```
If you receive an error message (e.g., "command not found"), first install Git by following the instructions on [this page](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

After installing Git, create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account (personal, not enterprise).
Once your account is created, you can create a new repository by clicking the "+" symbol in the top right corner and selecting "Create repository."

![]({{ "/images/git-0.png" | absolute_url }})

Name the repository according to the topic of your project. **Select "Public"**.
If you want to complete all the repository management exercises on this page, check the box "Add a README file".
You can also choose a ".gitignore" file suitable for your programming language (more about .gitignore below).

![]({{ "/images/git-1.png" | absolute_url }})

## Generating an SSH Key on Your Computer
Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

## Preparing the Repository for Use
**NOTE:** In this guide, "command line" refers to the terminal on Linux and Mac, and Git Bash on Windows! Windows' own command prompts do not recognize Git commands.

Navigate to the repository you created on GitHub. You can access it from the homepage after logging in by clicking on the repository name.

![]({{ "/images/git-2.png" | absolute_url }})

Click the "Code" button, and select "SSH" in the pop-up window.

![]({{ "/images/git-3.png" | absolute_url }})

Copy the repository URL that appears, which should be in the format:
git@github.com:your-username/project-name.git
You can copy the address by clicking the symbol next to it.

Open the command line and clone the repository to your computer using the command ```git clone "repository-url"```
```

```
If you encounter an SSH-related error, go back to the previous section.
In the command line, navigate to the folder you just cloned using the command ```cd project-name```
You can list all the files with the command ```ls```.
The README file should be visible when you run the ls command.
```
jezberg@LM2-500-27156 Documents % cd harjoitustyo 
jezberg@LM2-500-27156 harjoitustyo % ls
README.md
jezberg@LM2-500-27156 harjoitustyo % 
```
If the README is not visible, you forgot to select "Add a README" during repository creation.

Now, add all the files related to the project to this folder. They can be pushed to GitHub from there. Next, we will practice using Git with three exercises.

# Repository Exercise 1: Editing
Make sure you're in the repository folder in the command line.
Open the README file with any text editor you prefer.
Write something in the file and save it.
![]({{ "/images/git-4.png" | absolute_url }})

Run the following command in the command line: ```git status```
Now, you should see a list of the files you've modified (marked as "modified"), in this case, the README file.
```
jezberg@LM2-500-27156 harjoitustyo % git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
From this, you can see that the README.md file has been modified since the last commit.
To commit (save) these changes, we generally first need to add the modified files to the commit and then commit them with a descriptive message.
However, if we want to save all changes, we can use the -a flag with the commit command. You can directly write the commit message using the -m flag.
``` 
jezberg@LM2-500-27156 harjoitustyo % git commit -am "first modification"
[main 1351813] first modification
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
jezberg@LM2-500-27156 harjoitustyo % 
```
If you forget to include a message with the ```commit``` command (e.g., "first modification"), an editor will open (most likely Vim or Nano) where you can write your commit message. If you're not familiar with using the editor, you can exit it by typing ```q```.
Then, re-enter the ```commit``` command with a proper message.
The changes you've made (modifying the README file) are now in your local repository. To push them to your GitHub repository, use the following command:
```git push```
```
jezberg@LM2-500-27156 harjoitustyo % git push                      
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 311 bytes | 311.00 KiB/s, done.

To github.com:jezberg/harjoitustyo.git
   4b835c6..1351813  main -> main

```
If git push gives the message "Permission denied (publickey)", try generating the SSH key again or use the command ```ssh-add```.
Go to your repository view on GitHub (as mentioned in step 1 of the previous instructions) and refresh the page. You'll notice that the changes you made to the README file are now on GitHub, along with the commit message you provided!
![]({{ "/images/git-5.png" | absolute_url }})
# Repository Exercise 2: Adding a File
Navigate to your repository folder in the command line.
Run the command ```mkdir test-folder```
This will create a new folder called test-folder.
Next, add a file to the folder: Find the folder you created on your computer and either create or move e.g. a text file into it.
```
jezberg@LM2-500-27156 harjoitustyo % mkdir test-folder 
jezberg@LM2-500-27156 harjoitustyo % ls
README.md	test-folder
jezberg@LM2-500-27156 harjoitustyo % vim test-folder/test-file.txt
jezberg@LM2-500-27156 harjoitustyo % ls
README.md	test-folder
jezberg@LM2-500-27156 harjoitustyo % ls test-folder/ 
test-file.txt
```
To add the folder you've created to version control, run the following command in the command line:```git add test-folder```
Now, Git will track your folder, meaning that it is visible with the git status command. You can also commit it to the local version control.
Note: An empty folder will not become tracked by Git with the ```add``` command.
Next, commit the changes by running the following command: 
``` 
jezberg@LM2-500-27156 harjoitustyo % git commit -m "new test file"
[main 96644ec] new test file
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 test-folder/test-file.txt
```
Note that the -a flag is not needed here because we previously used the ```git add``` command. It's important to remember that the -a flag with the commit command does not add new files; it only saves changes to files that have already been added. In other words, when adding new files, you must always use the ```git add``` command separately.

Run command ```git push```.
Then, check your repository view on GitHub to confirm that your new folder and the file inside it have appeared.
![]({{ "/images/git-5.png" | absolute_url }})

If you want to add multiple files at once, you can use the command ```git add```.
This will add all new files in the current folder (.) to version control.

Now you know how to add files and folders to GitHub: add - commit - push! Follow the same process to create a documentation folder for your project and add the necessary documentation for the first week inside it.
# Repository Exercise 3: Pull - Fetching Changes from GitHub
If you are working on multiple computers, version control helps keep your project up to date without having to transfer files from one device to another, such as using a USB stick. This is one of the benefits of version control! In this exercise, you will practice copying files from GitHub to your local machine using a second repository clone folder. In a real-world scenario, this second clone folder would be on a different device. You donâ€™t need the second clone (shadow-repo) for anything other than this exercise.
Create another clone of the repository with a different name (e.g., shadow-repo) by running the following command in the command line:
```git clone git@github.com:your-username/project-name.git shadow-repo```

```jezberg@LM2-500-27156 Documents % git clone git@github.com:jezberg/harjoitustyo.git shadow-repo
Cloning into 'shadow-repo'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 11, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (11/11), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (7/7), done.
remote: Total 11 (delta 1), reused 6 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (11/11), done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), done.
```
The clone is created just as in the [section on preparing the repository for use](https://algolabra-hy.github.io/git-en#preparing-the-repository-for-use), except now you name the clone folder yourself.
Modify the README file in the original repository. Then, run commands ```add```, ```commit```, and ```push``` in the original repository clone folder to ensure your changes are pushed to GitHub.
```
