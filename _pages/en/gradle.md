[Gradle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradle) is a [build automation tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation) designed to automate project management tasks such as compiling and testing software.
Gradle is primarily used for Java project development. However, there are also unofficial [Python plugins](https://github.com/PrzemyslawSwiderski/python-gradle-plugin) that enable its use for Python project development. You may use these plugins in your coursework, but their functionality has not been tested by the course staff.
That said, since Python code does not need to be compiled (and cannot be easily compiled), Gradle is somewhat unnecessarily complex for use with Python. Instead, use [Poetry]({% link _pages/en/poetry.md %}) for Python projects.

## Introduction to Gradle Configuration (for Java)
These instructions are almost a direct copy from the [Software Engineering course pages](https://ohjelmistotuotanto-hy.github.io/gradle/).

We will create a Gradle project from scratch. Start by creating a new directory in your [project repository]({% link _pages/en/git.md %}) and navigate into it.

Check if the ```gradle``` command works on your system. Note that, for example, freshman laptops may have a very old version of Gradle installed. Running the command will show which version is in use.
```
mluukkai@melkki:~$ gradle  
Starting a Gradle Daemon (subsequent builds will be faster)  

> Task :help  

Welcome to Gradle 4.4.1.
```
If the command does not work **or the version is older than 6.7**, install the latest version of Gradle following the instructions [here](https://gradle.org/install/).
Start by running the command ```gradle```:
```
> Task :help

Welcome to Gradle 8.6.

Directory '/Users/jezberg/Documents/teaching/tiralabra/gradletest' does not contain a Gradle build.

To create a new build in this directory, run gradle init

```
The output indicates that no Gradle build exists in the current directory, meaning the Gradle project has not been initialized yet.
A Gradle project is defined using a file named _build.gradle_ in the root of the project directory.
You can create this file by running the init task (i.e., executing the command ```gradle init```).
Next, let's run the init command.
```
jezberg@LM2-500-27156 gradletest % gradle init 

Select type of project to generate:
  1: basic
  2: application
  3: library
  4: Gradle plugin
Enter selection (default: basic) [1..4] 
```
Select _basic_ (type of project), _Groovy_ (build script DSL), and provide a name for the project. Also, choose "no" when asked about new API features.
After running the operation, you'll notice that in addition to the _build.gradle_ file, other files, and directories have been created in the project directory:
<pre>
$ ls -la

-rw-r--r--  1 jezberg  ATKK\hyad-all   345 Feb  6 17:06 settings.gradle
</pre>
The directory _.gradle_ should be added to _.gitignore_. In Gradle projects, the _build_ directory should always be gitignored, as it contains all files generated by Gradle tasks. Fortunately, Gradle automatically creates an appropriate _.gitignore_ file for this setup.

Our goal is to add Java code and JUnit tests to the project. By default, Gradle does not recognize Java, but by enabling the _java-plugin_, it adds new tasks related to compiling Java code.

Start by running the command ```gradle```.
```
> Task :help

Welcome to Gradle 6.7.

```
The instructions guide us as follows:
"To see a list of available tasks, run gradle tasks."
So, let's try executing the command ```gradle tasks```.
```
> Task :tasks

------------------------------------------------------------
Tasks runnable from root project
------------------------------------------------------------

Build Setup tasks
-----------------
init - Initializes a new Gradle build.
wrapper - Generates Gradle wrapper files.

Help tasks
----------
buildEnvironment - Displays all buildscript dependencies declared in root project 'intro_gradle'.
components - Displays the components produced by root project 'intro_gradle'. [incubating]
dependencies - Displays all dependencies declared in root project 'intro_gradle'.
dependencyInsight - Displays the insight into a specific dependency in root project 'intro_gradle'.
dependentComponents - Displays the dependent components of components in root project 'intro_gradle'. [incubating]
help - Displays a help message.
model - Displays the configuration model of root project 'intro_gradle'. [incubating]
outgoingVariants - Displays the outgoing variants of root project 'intro_gradle'.
projects - Displays the sub-projects of root project 'intro_gradle'.
properties - Displays the properties of root project 'intro_gradle'.
tasks - Displays the tasks runnable from root project 'intro_gradle'.
```
The command lists the available _tasks_. Gradle's [documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/tutorial_using_tasks.html) describes tasks as follows:

> Each project is made up of one or more tasks. A task represents some atomic piece of work which a build performs. This might be compiling some classes, creating a JAR, generating Javadoc, or publishing some archives to a repository

Tasks are essentially "commands" that we can execute for Gradle projects.

Now, let's enable the _java-plugin_ by adding a line to the _build.gradle_ file:
<pre>
plugins {
    id 'java'
}
</pre>
When we now run the ```gradle tasks``` command, we will notice that there are new tasks in the list, which were added by the _java-plugin_:
<pre>
Build tasks
-----------
assemble - Assembles the outputs of this project.
build - Assembles and tests this project.
buildDependents - Assembles and tests this project and all projects that depend on it.
buildNeeded - Assembles and tests this project and all projects it depends on.
classes - Assembles main classes.
clean - Deletes the build directory.
jar - Assembles a jar archive containing the main classes.
testClasses - Assembles test classes.

Build Setup tasks
-----------------
init - Initializes a new Gradle build.
wrapper - Generates Gradle wrapper files.

Documentation tasks
-------------------
javadoc - Generates Javadoc API documentation for the main source code.

...

Verification tasks
------------------
check - Runs all checks.
test - Runs the unit tests.
</pre>
If we execute, for example, the task _build_, meaning the command ```gradle build```, the output is as follows:
<pre>
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 885ms
</pre>
This doesn't explain much yet. The [documentation for the Java plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_plugin.html#sec:java_tasks) clarifies the matter:
![]({{ "/images/lh2-1.png" | absolute_url }})
So, _build_ depends on two plugins: _check_ and _assemble_.
![]({{ "/images/lh2-2.png" | absolute_url }})
These also depend on a few tasks. In the end, ```gradle build``` executes all the following tasks:
<pre>
compileJava
processResources 
classes
jar
assemble
compileTestJava
processTestResources
testClasses
test
check
</pre>
So, _build_ compiles the code, packages it into a JAR file, and runs the project's tests.  

Before moving forward, execute ```gradle clean```, which removes all files created by the previous command.
## A reasonable editor  

This time, don't use NetBeans. Instead, write all code and configurations using a text editor.  

A good choice for an editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), which is available on the department's computers and freshmen laptops.

## Adding Code to the Project  

Gradle assumes that the program's code is located in the directory _src/main/java_ under the project root.  

Create the necessary directory (or directories) and the file _src/main/java/Main.java_ with the following example content:
<pre>
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello gradle!");
    }
}
</pre>
Then, execute the task _compileJava_ and inspect the contents of the project directory using the command _tree_:
<pre>
$ tree
.
├── build
│   ├── classes
│   │   └── java
│   │       └── main
│   │           └── Main.class
...
</pre>
**Remember** that Gradle commands must be executed from the project root, i.e., the directory where the _build.gradle_ file is located.  

The task _compileJava_ has now created the _build_ directory, containing the compiled _class_ file.  
Run the compiled code by navigating to the appropriate directory and executing the command ```java Main```:
<pre>
$ cd build/classes/java/main/
$ java Main
Hello gradle!
</pre>
Usually, Java code is not executed directly using _class_ files. A better approach is to package the code into a _jar_ file.  

The _jar_ file is created using the Gradle task _jar_. The help command provides the following information:
<pre>
% gradle help --task jar

> Task :help

Description

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
1 actionable task: 1 executed
</pre>
To define the _main class location_ for the task, add the following to the end of the _build.gradle_ file:
<pre>
jar {
    manifest {
        attributes 'Main-Class': 'Main'
    }
}
</pre>
Note that the _build.gradle_ file must begin with the _plugins_ definition. If it is not at the beginning, you will encounter the following error message:
<pre>
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* Where:
Build file '/Users/mluukkai/dev/intro_gradle/build.gradle' line: 7

...

@ line 7, column 1.
  plugins {
</pre>
Now, return to the project root directory and execute the task _jar_ to generate the JAR file (i.e., run the command ```gradle jar```).  

You can run the generated JAR file as follows (note that the file name depends on your project name and is likely not _gradle-test.jar_):
<pre>
$ java -jar build/libs/gradle-test.jar
Hello gradle!
</pre>
## application-plugin
In principle, you can also run the code using the command ```gradle run```.  

However, this currently results in the error message:  
_Task 'run' not found in root project._  

The reason is that the _run_ task is not defined by the Java plugin but by the [Application plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/application_plugin.html).  

To enable this, modify the beginning of the _build.gradle_ file as follows:
<pre>
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'application'
}
</pre>
In fact, the line defining the _java_ plugin is no longer needed since the _application_ plugin already includes the necessary tasks.  

However, running the command ```gradle run``` now results in the error:  
_No main class specified._  

According to the [plugin documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/application_plugin.html), the _main class_ must be specified by adding the following line to the _build.gradle_ file:
<pre>
application {
    mainClass = 'Main'
}
</pre>
Now, running the program using the task works:
<pre>
$ gradle run
> Task :compileJava UP-TO-DATE
> Task :processResources NO-SOURCE
> Task :classes UP-TO-DATE

> Task :run
Hello gradle!

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
</pre>
It’s best to run the program using the _-q_ option, which suppresses Gradle’s own output:
<pre>
$ gradle run -q
Hello gradle!
</pre>
Let's extend the program so that it asks for the user's name using a Scanner object:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("kuka olet: ");
        String nimi = scanner.nextLine();

        System.out.println("Hello " + nimi);
    }
}
```
If the program is packaged into a _jar_ file (by running the ```gradle jar``` command), it will work as expected:
<pre>
$ java -jar build/libs/gradle-test.jar
kuka olet:
mluukkai
Hello mluukkai
</pre>
If the program is executed using Gradle's _run_ task, the result will be an error:
<pre>
$ gradle run
kuka olet:
Exception in thread "main" java.util.NoSuchElementException: No line found
        at java.util.Scanner.nextLine(Scanner.java:1540)
        at Main.main(Main.java:7)

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':run'.
> Process 'command '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.11.0_101.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java'' finished with non-zero exit value 1

</pre>
The reason for this is that by default, Gradle's _run_ task does not attach the terminal to the input stream _System.in_. This can be fixed by adding the following to the _build.gradle_ file:
<pre>
run {
    standardInput = System.in
}
</pre>
