## **Project Management**  

Below are some recommended tools for project management. These are primarily for students who are not already familiar with such tools. **You are not required to use these specific tools** — feel free to use any that suit your workflow better.  

These pages include condensed material, especially from the **Software Engineering** course.

### **Projects in Python**  

- **[Poetry]({% link _pages/en/poetry.md %})** is a tool designed for managing dependencies in Python projects.  
- **[Pylint]({% link _pages/en/pylint.md %})** is a static analysis tool for Python that helps maintain high code quality.

### **Projects in Java**  

- **[Gradle]({% link _pages/en/gradle.md %})** is a build automation tool primarily for Java, streamlining compilation and testing tasks.  
- While Gradle **can** be used also for [Python development](https://github.com/PrzemyslawSwiderski/python-gradle-plugin), **Poetry is strongly recommended** for Python projects.
