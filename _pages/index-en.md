These pages contain materials related to the University of Helsinki's [Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence](https://studies.helsinki.fi/kurssit/opintojakso/otm-3d27dcc5-f7b5-4eec-b5db-53217aee3918/TKT20010) course exercise.

## Read Moodle First
You can explore these pages to get a general overview of the course flow even before enrolling. However, if you have already enrolled, make sure to read first the [course implementation Moodle pages]({{site.moodle}}), where the course objectives, structure, and grading are explained in more detail. These pages assume that you have already familiarized yourself with the Moodle materials and may seem confusing if you haven't.
