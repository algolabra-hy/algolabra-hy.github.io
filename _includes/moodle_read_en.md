    <h2>(If you have already signed up) Read the moodle first</h2>
    
    <p>
      The <a href="{{site.moodle}}">Moodle pages</a> of the course contain important information
      which you should read before studying these pages, including information about the 
      aims of the project and its grading. The moodle pages also link to the most relevant parts of these pages. 
      These pages expect you to be familiar with the contents of the moodle and can feel confusing if you do not.
